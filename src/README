## Main
`runSubmodules.sh` - runs each module of the solution

`cflow2png.sh` - takes in a path to a .cflow file and outputs a PNG flow diagram
`cflowGenerate.sh` - runs cflow on a set of c files
`cflowVisualize.sh` - visualizes in PNG diagrams for an entire dir of cflow files

# Dangerous A before B
TODO(eugenek):

## File scraping 
`docScrape.py` - does the web scraping to get files

## Exec* Checking
`syschecker.py` - looks for potentially dangerous exec* calls

## Return checking
`returnCheckerSubmodule.py` - looks for unused/unset return values
